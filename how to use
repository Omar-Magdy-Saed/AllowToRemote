To use the provided script, follow these steps:

1. Understand the Purpose
The script sets up passwordless SSH access to a remote server by generating an SSH key (if not already present) and aligning it with the remote server's authorized_keys.

2. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Bash installed on your system.
Verify that you have SSH access to the remote server with the root user.
Make sure the script has execute permissions.
3. Steps to Use the Script
a. Save the Script
Save the script to a file, e.g., remote-to-allow.sh.

b. Make the Script Executable
Run the following command in the terminal to make the script executable:
chmod +x remote-to-allow.sh
c. Run the Script
Execute the script with the remote server's IP address as an argument:
./remote-to-allow.sh <REMOTE_SERVER_IP>
Example:
./remote-to-allow.sh 192.168.1.10
4. What Happens When You Run It
The script checks if the remote server is reachable using ping.
If no SSH key exists, it generates one using ssh-keygen.
It aligns the local SSH public key (id_dsa.pub) with the remote server's authorized_keys.
It tests the SSH connection to ensure passwordless access is set up correctly.
5. Expected Output
If successful, you will see a message like:
allow remote server successfully completed
If there is an error, the script will display an appropriate error message.
6. Notes
Replace <REMOTE_SERVER_IP> with the actual IP address of the remote server.
Ensure you have the necessary permissions to execute the script and access the remote server.
